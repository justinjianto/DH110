Justin Jianto, DH110
### Description
I want to improve the websites below by creating a more sleek and streamlined website that is able to deliver content clearly. Furthermore create a consistent website design.

### Initial Evaluation
My initial thoughts on the website was that it presented a lot of good information and I liked the structure it broke down learning different types of music: level, instrument, and instructor. However, the main page is a little hard to follow with an overload of text and a cluttered design. Furthermore, interacting with the page more it is hard to sometimes derive exactly what the purpose of a page is, which is exacerbated with inconsisten action of clickable icons.

### About the website
This website is a subscription platform thats lets people to learn to play instruments or sing through a series of videos taught by professionals. Furthermore, it is broken down by type of instrument and then by the level of the user: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert
### Evaluation
10 Heuristics
1. Visibility of System Status
  - There is little signs of visibility of system status as we move from page to page, it does not give us signs of where we were previously. It provides information of the path of the page we are in, but this information is not relevant to us.
  - Some visibility that it does show is showing our filters that we search on when looking for instruments or teachers
  - To improve upon this, some ideas would be to create a processes that allows for users to show what they are working/shopping music classes for and what comes next
  - 1/3
2. Match between System and the Real world
  - The largest thing that stands out to me is that many icons are used along with text, but these icons do not reflect the content of the text. For instance, when they talk about physical music lessons they use a pencil, which is confusing
  -  A portion of the website has an arrow that you can click to cycle through different options of teachers, but when getting to the last one it redirects to another page instead of cycling back to front
  -  A solution of fixing and finding all these problems is running multiple tests, having people go through the website and finding these errors
  -  2/3
3. User Control and Freedom
  - Imusic school does a good job of providing an avenue out to get back to the main page when overwhelmed. The logo up top is clickable to allow for users to return to the home page. Furthermore, they provide a navigation bar that allows for quick navigation out. 
  - When doing filters on Instruments and teachers they provide a button to reset the settings you chose to easily start a new search
4. Consistency and Standards
  - The consistency is lacking in the website, some of the icons when hovered on dissapear while others do not. 
  - The spacing of text changes between different chunks of text
  - A portion of the website has an arrow that you can click to cycle through different options of teachers, but when getting to the last one it redirects to another page instead of cycling back to front
  - 2/3
5. Error Prevention
  - There is a problem with error prevention, which we can recreate by when resizing the window and then clicking the side menu and login, when clicking on login it redirects to a not found page with no other information
  - This could be fixed with any unexpected errors to be caught and automatically redirected to a default screen saying not sure what happened and bring back to main page
  - 3/3
6. Recognition rather than recall
  - The website does a good job about not requiring knowing of information, it has a navigation bar that stays as we go from page to page, thus not needing to know what page we were on previously
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
  - I also think the website does a good job of flexibility, it provides users with a default home page that contains all information, but it also has tabs that allows for users to directly go to lessons, teachers, and tools. Furthermore, it has a login page that allows for people to directly login without going throughout the whole website
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
  - The website is not very well designed aesthetically in my opinion, it has too much cluttered information of the home page making it hard to process all the information
  - 3/3
9. Help Users Recognize, Diagonse, and Recover from Errors
  - Similar vein to 5, when the error screen arises it pops up an error code that a user will not know anything about, thus we can follow the same course of action as we mentioned in 5
  - 3/3
10. Help and Documentation
  - The help and documentation is somewhat lacking, with only an email and a very hidden faq at the bottom of the page.
  - This could be expanded upon through having question mark icons we can hover over to get instant help with that page view
  - 1/3

### URL
[Website Link](https://splice.com/sounds/beatmaker)
### About the website
Splice is a website that allows for users to quickly create beats online using different electronic instruments and allowing for switching out of different music sets.
### Initial Thoughts
I really like the interface that Splice provides, which directly allows for users to quickly to start playing with different music sounds. However, after looking deeper it provides very little help in terms of how to work beyond the basics, as in using the different sets for instruments in the bottom. It requires a lot of expirementing from the end user to guess and check what is happening
