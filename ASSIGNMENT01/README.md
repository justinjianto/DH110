### URL
[Website Link](https://www.imusic-school.com/en/)
### About the website
This website is a subscription platform thats lets people to learn to play instruments or sing through a series of videos taught by professionals. Furthermore, it is broken down by type of instrument and then by the level of the user: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert
### Evaluation
10 Heuristics
1. Visibility of System Status
  - There is very little signs of visibility of system status as we move from page to page, it does not give us signs of where we were previously. It provides information of the path of the page we are in, but this information is not relevant to us.
  - Some visibility that it does show is showing our filters that we search on when looking for instruments or teachers
  - To improve upon this, some ideas would be to create a processes that allows for users to show what they are working/shopping music classes for and what comes next
2. Match between System and the Real world
  - The largest thing that stands out to me is that many icons are used along with text, but these icons do not reflect the content of the text. For instance, when they talk about physical music lessons they use a pencil, which is confusing
  -  A portion of the website has an arrow that you can click to cycle through different options of teachers, but when getting to the last one it redirects to another page instead of cycling back to front
3. User Control and Freedom
  - Imusic school does a good job of providing an avenue out to get back to the main page when overwhelmed. The logo up top is clickable to allow for users to return to the home page. Furthermore, they provide a navigation bar that allows for quick navigation out. 
  - When doing filters on Instruments and teachers they provide a button to reset the settings you chose to easily start a new search
4. Consistency and Standards
  - The consistency is lacking in the website, some of the icons when hovered on dissapear while others do not. 
  - The spacing of text changes between different chunks of text
  - A portion of the website has an arrow that you can click to cycle through different options of teachers, but when getting to the last one it redirects to another page instead of cycling back to front
5. Error Prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
