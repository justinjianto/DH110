# Purpose of UT:
The purpose of the UT was to test how usable the website was to a brand new user who just started making beats would react to the website. I did this through focusing on 3 main tasks that a typical user would go through. First would be creating a beat from scratch and playing it. Then it goes through a developmental process, where a user would modify the beat and add different sounds. Lastly, is the process of adding finishing touches on the beat, such as tempo change and saving the beat and starting a new project. From my previous research, through a heuristic evaluation, I found the largest holes to be in User Control and Freedom, Help and Documentation, and Error Prevention. Thus, I wanted to create my tasks to be able to see if others would run into these issues I highlighted by performing tasks that are made ambiguous by the website and lead to potentially deleting their beats on accident.
