# Purpose of UT:
The purpose of the UT was to test how usable the website was to a brand new user who just started making beats would react to the website. I did this through focusing on 3 main tasks that a typical user would go through. First would be creating a beat from scratch and playing it. Then it goes through a developmental process, where a user would modify the beat and add different sounds. Lastly, is the process of adding finishing touches on the beat, such as tempo change and saving the beat and starting a new project. From my previous research, through a heuristic evaluation, I found the largest holes to be in User Control and Freedom, Help and Documentation, and Error Prevention. Thus, I wanted to create my tasks to be able to see if others would run into these issues I highlighted by performing tasks that are made ambiguous by the website and lead to potentially deleting their beats on accident.

# Reflection:
One paragraph describing what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what did not go well, focusing on how you want to improve your UT in the future.

After conducting the pilot test I learned it was hard being an impartial moderator, as I wanted to constantly interject with how I would do, but I would have to be quiet and observe what the user is doing. I think the tasks went well and smooth, in laying out what the user had to do. However at certain points the participant would ask for help and it would take me some time to generate some answers to respond without giving away answers. In the future I want to have more robust cases for testing and more comprehensive follow up questions. I think I can allow for more user interactions instead of rigid set questions through asking open ended questions.
