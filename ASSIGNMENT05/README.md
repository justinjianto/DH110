# Description of Goal

SUMMARY: Our goal is to draw out the actual tasks of creation and sharing of music production. This will allow us to better optimize the flow that users of our application will take when they are going to use our product, showing visually what each button will do, instead of just describing it

PERSONA: Our wireframes and flow will be based off of the tasks our previous personas have executed, from creating beats from scratch and learning how to make music for Divan and sharing of beats for Jonah, people who have an interest in music production.

PURPOSE: The purpose of low fidelity prototyping is to allow us to have a rough early visualization of what our design looks like for our application. Furthermore, from this we can improve and iterate from our design by showing this to others and getting their feedback, seeing if our product is satisfying the users goals.

# List of Tasks (2)

- creation and saving of a simple beat
- Being able to share the best with other people

# Wireframes and Wireflow

The Wireframes and Wireflow can be found here: [click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pgod3UcIANDXpYFDSv5ntm2NoCQmVhtms6Leiyhg7ts/edit?usp=sharing)

# Testing

I tested the 2 flows with 2 people and here is the video recording of it.

# Reflection

Starting off with the process I went through a couple different tools to create the wireframe. I first started by drawing it out by hand, which proved to be cumbersome and did not look good. Thus, I switched over to whimsical, which led to a much smoother development. I was able to copy components and create screens much quicker due to all the features they provided. In terms of creating the content itself, I based it off of the tasks I created previously, but I had to tweak it a little bit, as I realized some of what I wrote did not translate over to a visual form.

Based off the feedback from my prototype testing I would add a screen that gives an explanation or add another help button for the main interface, since he was confused on how to use the actual beat creation itself, which in my mind was going to be self explanatory.

If I were to redo this from scratch I think I would walk through each of my screens with a tester first, since I created the frame and flow all together it is repetitive work to change when my tester gave me feedback.
