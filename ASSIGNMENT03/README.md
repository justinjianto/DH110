# Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry

# Description of Project

What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

- The goal of my project is to allow for middle aged men who want to learn how to make their own beats

What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

- The basic need/goal that will be satisfied is a cognitive lead, as many times people are curious on how songs they listen are created and learning how to create beats/songs themselves will satisfy their curiosity

What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

- The current traditional solutions are watching tutorial videos that are sometimes cumbersome to go through as you need to follow along and not all people have access to expensive beat creation software. Another avenue is through exposure, when they have been around beat producing through friends or families and are taught that way. Both of these solutions are not accessible

What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?

- As mentioned before the current solutions have high barriers of entry, which requires either extensive background knowledge and what to search or having connections to teach you, which most people do not access too. This could be improved upon by creating a free online streamlined service that allows for learning/creation of beats, by anyone with a computer and an internet connection


What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)

- Demographic: The demographic is anyone that has internet connection and has a desire to learn to make beats
- Preference: The preferences are middle aged men that have interests in music production and rudimentary knowledge about music in general such as bpm, notes and are able to browse the internet
- Expertise: Users do not need to have any expertise in music production, basic understanding of music theory such as bpm, beats may prove to be helpful, but not required
- The app is meant to be mainstream, used by everyone, not highly specialized to cater to a small group of people


- The research method used will be by participatory observation research

# Insights

From the interview I learned that a large barrier to entry of music production is the barrier of cost, which I did not think about. My interviewer mentioned that the cost of the software he uses to create beats was too high on multiple occassions and his biggest gripe. I did not consider that newcomers may not even want to pay for these expensive softwares. Furthermore, it seems like people on the software are using it for a highly specialzied purpose. For instance the participant was only using the software to create trap and rap beats exclusively.
# Reflection

Setting up the script proved to be more challenging than I thought, since I wanted it to be as general as possible, but still getting the insights that I wanted and not asking incorrect questions that lead to irrelevant details. Furthermore, in the actual interview I noticed I was much more surprised than the UT. In the UT I was not super surprised with the responses, since it was super controlled, but in this field research I was not expecting the answers I expected at all. Furthermore, in this scenario it felt less like a moderator participant, but rather a casual conversation where one person tries to learn from the other person. Due to this, sometimes I would have to depart from the script and ask questions on the fly.
