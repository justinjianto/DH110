# Introduction
The goal of my project is to provide a music production application that is easy for newcomers to make beats and share with others. The purpose of the interactive prototype is to lay out a high level flow of how the application will look like and work without fully implementing it yet. This allows for easy tweaking and testing of the application with others before creating the application. The process started with the low fidelity prototype as the baseline for general layout. Next I improved upon the low fidelity prototype by creating each screen using design principles/tools such as gridding, contrast of color, font size, buttons, etc. After all the screens were created we had to add and test interactivity between screens.

# Tasks Supported

1. Creation of a brand new beat that allows for adding a note on a drumm changing BPM, and Saving a beat
2. Sharing of a beat with others and resetting back to a new screen

# Cognitive Walkthrough

Evidence of Cognitive walkthrough:

Cognitive walkthrough was conducted through zoom in class, where recording was not possible, but below is attached document of the feedback provided by participants.

Summary:

Some of the feedback I addressed in the cognitive test was to make some of the buttons more clear and visual changes to the interactivity. For visuals, instead of using just circular buttons to mark beats it fills in the whole block. For saving screen to provide users more control, for instance when they accidently tap it, there should be a cancel option added. Furthermore, a clear button was added to reset the whole screen. I also provided more context on popup screens. 

The process of cognitive walkthrough was smooth, conducted over zoom with 2 participants. It was my first time conducting an interview with 2 people and it provided more insights, as sometimes they would come to same conclusions on feedback and this showed me that if 2 people agreed than most others would too. In comparison when doing a one on one interview it is hard to tell if it is a common opinion or just that specific persons
