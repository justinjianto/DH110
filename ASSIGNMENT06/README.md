# Description 

The purpose of this assignment was to go from our low fidelity prototype to a working design, starting with a single screen. I decided to focus on the frame that would be the homepage of my application. I envisision that my application will be mostly used on laptops and tablets, so I am choosing to do a prototype as a ipad mini application. I first started out with the layout of things, creating a grid of how I wanted things to be seen. From this I tested through trial and error, adding buttons and text in ways I think would look good and drafted up multiple different types and mized and matched. I also kept feedback from the low fidelity prototyping in mind when creating the frame through figma.
Here is a link out to the different designs I did for the frame: https://www.figma.com/file/ToPLurTeI053tIWrjFu4aa/Assignment-6?node-id=0%3A1

I started off the design with having the layout being the central piece, I envisioned something that my music production app should be the dead center product and everything else being accessories, from this I created the 8x15 grid. I wanted to keep the gutter small since I wanted to make sure to users that the main component is all grouped together. Next was the color scheme, I knew I wanted purple, but I was not sure what else would contrast well with it, so I chose it based off trial and error after googling what colors paired well with purple.
