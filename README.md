## About this Project

The goal of this project was to create a music learning app that would be catered towards middle aged men of varying music levels. Specifically, I am creating an ipad application that allows for users to learn and produce their own beats through a streamlined platform and share the beat with others to collaborate/gain feedback. 

The motivation of the project is that the barrier to entry for music production is high, with common products like fruity loops being very expensive, only accessible through a computer application, and  being hard to get started with due to its complexity. My application is meant to strip away the complexity and provide explanations that people can easily use.

## Design Statement

The main issues are that current music production apps are **nonintuitive, expensive,** and, **separate doing and learning**. Thus, this limits the application to people who already have extensive knowledge in the domain or have friends that can teach them, leaving people who want to learn from scratch frustrated. My product allows for a large general demographic to **learn and create music production on the same platform**, **share/collaborate with friends**, for those who take it more casual or are just starting out, providing a frustration **free** solution.

## Competitor analysis

Before starting I did extensive research into alternate solutions and performed Heuristic Analysis and Usability Testing on [https://splice.com/sounds/beatmaker](https://splice.com/sounds/beatmaker), the closest web application to what I wanted to create. A quick summary of HA, I really like the interface that Splice provides, which directly allows for users to quickly to start playing with different music sounds. However, after looking deeper it provides very little help in terms of how to work beyond the basics, as in using the different sets for instruments in the bottom. It requires a lot of expirementing from the end user to guess and check what is happening.
More Specifically, I found that the website had major issues in **Help and Documentation** and **User Control and Freedom**. The website provided a tool to create beats, but did not explain at all in how to use it and was limited in the options it provided. 

Next I conducted user testing to see if my Heurisitic Analysis would be agreed with. The tasks that I had my participant do was **creating a simple beat**, **modifying the beat**, and **saving the beat**. From the results my participant had trouble with creating a beat as he was confused with what was he was able and not able to do, in agreement with my heuristic analysis. Some other feedback provided was the application felt **Busy**, **Cheap**, and **Intimidating**

## User Research

Wanting to tailor the product to be intuitive to newcomers wanting to produce music I conducted user research with a participant that created rap beats casually in his free time to gain any insights that he had. The insights that I took away was that a large barrier to entry of music production is the **barrier of cost**, which I did not think about. My interviewer mentioned that the cost of the software he uses to create beats was too high on multiple occasions and his biggest gripe. I did not consider that newcomers may not even want to pay for these expensive softwares. Furthermore, it seems like people on the software are using it for a **highly specialized purpose**, the participant was only using the software to create trap and rap beats exclusively.

## UX storytelling

In a similar vein to User Research, I performed UX storytelling which allows for us to better understand what type of music producers our product is going to be catered towards, thinking from the end users perspective instead of a designers perspective. From storytelling we can align our design to satisfy the requirements that real people have when they are creating music. For instance, I will focus on the story of 2 very different users, one that is producing music to learn more about beats and for his own edification. The other user will be using the service as more of a social tool, collaborating with other people on a hobby he loves. From creating these stories we can better keep in mind what the users want and design a product that fits all sorts of people.

## Wireframe and graphic design element variation

After conducting ample research and interviewing people our next task was to create a rudimentary wireframe of how the application would look. The wireframes wireframes and flow will be based off of the tasks our previous personas have executed, from creating beats from scratch and learning how to make music for Divan and sharing of beats for Jonah, people who have an interest in music production. The purpose of low fidelity prototyping is to allow us to have a rough early visualization of what our design looks like for our application. Furthermore, from this we can improve and iterate from our design by showing this to others and getting their feedback, seeing if our product is satisfying the users goals.

## Low-fidelity prototype

After finalizing and getting feedback from the first version of wireframe I moved to figma to implement the home frame of the beatmaker. The goal was to go from a low fidelity prototype to a working design, starting with a single screen. I decided to focus on the frame that would be the homepage of my application. I envisioned that my application will be mostly used on laptops and tablets, so I am choosing to do a prototype as a iPad mini application. I first started out with the layout of things, creating a grid of how I wanted things to be seen. From this I tested through trial and error, adding buttons and text in ways I think would look good and drafted up multiple different types and mixed and matched.

## High-fidelity prototype

Finally, we move from the low fidelity to the high fidelity prototype, creating designs for every single screen and creating interaction points. The purpose of the interactive prototype is to lay out a high level flow of how the application will look like and work without fully implementing it yet. This allows for easy tweaking and testing of the application with others before creating the application. In this step I also got 2 peers to do a cognitive walkthrough of my application and provide feedback of interactions which I improved upon, which was mostly logic changes of the interfaces and a few cosmetic changes.

## Conclusion

This was my first ever exposure to the process of UI/UX research and it was an eye opening and great learning experience. Coming in I assumed most of the process was just going through different iterations of web designs on Figma and did not know about all the research that went in before even thinking about starting a prototype. Going through the design process taught a lot to me about the importance of doing research into competitors, goals of what you are creating, usability, and gauging feedback in every single step of the process. My biggest takeaway is that a vision that a designer might have to be perfect might not be well catered towards the public/targeted audience, so we constantly have to keep this in mind, thinking and working with the end users who will ultimately be the ones using the product. Learning this process through creating my own application has been a great experience as I went through it myself.

Although in my career I will not be specifically going into UI/UX, but rather software engineering the takeaways are just as important in the field. I will now keep in mind when building products to have it fail safely, make it intuitive to use, and streamlined/simplistic as possible. Lasty and most importantly that I sometimes forget is that the process is not linear, rather you have to come back and revise over and over.
