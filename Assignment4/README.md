# Purpose of UX storytelling in project

UX storytelling allows for us to better understand what type of music producers our product is going to be catered towards, thinking from the end users perspective instead of a designers perspective. From storytelling we can align our design to satisfy the requirements that real people have when they are creating music. For instance, I will focus on the story of 2 very different users, one that is producing music to learn more about beats and for his own edification. The other user will be using the service as more of a social tool, collaborating with other people on a hobby he loves. From creating these stories we can better keep in mind what the users want and design a product that fits all sorts of people.
