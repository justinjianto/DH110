# Purpose of UX storytelling in project

UX storytelling allows for us to better understand what type of music producers our product is going to be catered towards, thinking from the end users perspective instead of a designers perspective. From storytelling we can align our design to satisfy the requirements that real people have when they are creating music. For instance, I will focus on the story of 2 very different users, one that is producing music to learn more about beats and for his own edification. The other user will be using the service as more of a social tool, collaborating with other people on a hobby he loves. From creating these stories we can better keep in mind what the users want and design a product that fits all sorts of people.

# Scenario 1

Divan Rim is a 40 year old software engineer living in San Francisco that has a casual interest in listening to music. He recently got promoted into a new role at his company Meta into a Senior Software Engineer, where he is now managing a team of 5 people. He is happy about his promotion, but to his surprise, it has brought on a lot of stress to him. Now he wants to make it a goal to have time outside of work when he is at home to destress and decides that he wants to further pursue his interest in music, since he always loved listening to music, but now wants to be able to make his own music. He believes by doing this it will allow for him to better manage his workplace stresses and develop his affinity for music. Furthermore, he wants to be able to use one website to achieve this, instead of navigating back and forth between different tutorials and tools, making it frustration free. He also wants to be able to track his progress over time, since he is a very analytical driven person, to see if he has improved over time and how his development has progressed.

When Divan gets home from work he opens up his personal laptop and likes to dive straight into making beats. He does not like reading through tutorials and them testing it out afterwards, but rather learns by doing. So he opens up our website that allows him to immediately start experimenting with beats. Since he does not know much he clicks on help buttons that correlate to each instrument that will explain to him what he is trying to do with that button. With this, Divan is able to quickly understand what the interface is doing and create the pattern he wants with the music. Since he gets home from work late, he does not have the time to finish up the production of his song in one sitting, but that is no worry, as the interface allows him to save his progress. When he comes back from work the next day he is able to pick right back up and finish the beat. After he is done the website automatically will save it for him and archive it with a name of his choosing, which satisfies him as he can track his progress over time.

# Scenario 2

Jonah Brodkey recently moved to New York to start a new principal researcher position at NYU. He originally was from Oregon working under a professor and the role was relatively relaxed, thus he spent a lot of his free time practicing and performing in a local orchestra. He enjoyed the social aspect orchestra provided as he was able to bond with a lot of his team members through their love for music. However, since moving and starting his new job, he lost this social connection and he does not have the time anymore to dedicate his time to an orchestra in New York. Thus, he is looking to recreate this but in an online setting to save time, but this time he shifts towards music production as he always led his orchestra and wrote their own pieces and would like to learn more about composition of music. More specifically, he wants to be able to combine a large social aspect with the music production, wanting to be able to share his music, view others, and work on other peoples beats. Furthermore, Jonah is not very technically literate, so he would like a service that is simple to use and not too complex.

Jonah quickly realizes early on that most of the software is not very social, rather focusing on just creating beats and do not really provide a way of interacting with others. He stumbles upon our website and sees that it is advertised as a social beat maker. Since he is more experienced with music, he is able to quickly pick up the interface and creates a quick short song just using drums and hi hats, he is more interested in the social aspect. Once he finishes the beat he wants to share it with others and he sees there is a feature to post the beat he created. He posts his beat and the next day he sees that multiple people have left comments and suggestions on his beats, some people like, some donâ€™t, but Jonah is ecstatic that he is able to interact with these people. He quickly gets involved and starts editing his beats again based off the feedback and he stumbles across another function. He can share the beat unfinished by itself with other people and they can also collaborate on it. Thus, he chooses to do this and sends the beat to a few of his commentors and they all happily work on the beat. At the end of this Jonah is satisfied as he is able to recreate the social aspect of Orchestra in a shorter time period and at a cost effective manner.
