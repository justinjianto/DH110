# Purpose of UX storytelling in project

UX storytelling allows for us to better understand what type of music producers our product is going to be catered towards, thinking from the end users perspective instead of a designers perspective. From storytelling we can align our design to satisfy the requirements that real people have when they are creating music. For instance, I will focus on the story of 2 very different users, one that is producing music to learn more about beats and for his own edification. The other user will be using the service as more of a social tool, collaborating with other people on a hobby he loves. From creating these stories we can better keep in mind what the users want and design a product that fits all sorts of people.

# Scenario 1

Divan Rim is a 40 year old software engineer living in San Francisco that has a casual interest in listening to music. He recently got promoted into a new role at his company Meta into a Senior Software Engineer, where he is now managing a team of 5 people. He is happy about his promotion, but to his surprise, it has brought on a lot of stress to him. Now he wants to make it a goal to have time outside of work when he is at home to destress and decides that he wants to further pursue his interest in music, since he always loved listening to music, but now wants to be able to make his own music. He believes by doing this it will allow for him to better manage his workplace stresses and develop his affinity for music. Furthermore, he wants to be able to use one website to achieve this, instead of navigating back and forth between different tutorials and tools, making it frustration free. He also wants to be able to track his progress over time, since he is a very analytical driven person, to see if he has improved over time and how his development has progressed.

When Divan gets home from work he opens up his personal laptop and likes to dive straight into making beats. He does not like reading through tutorials and them testing it out afterwards, but rather learns by doing. So he opens up our website that allows him to immediately start experimenting with beats. Since he does not know much he clicks on help buttons that correlate to each instrument that will explain to him what he is trying to do with that button. With this, Divan is able to quickly understand what the interface is doing and create the pattern he wants with the music. Since he gets home from work late, he does not have the time to finish up the production of his song in one sitting, but that is no worry, as the interface allows him to save his progress. When he comes back from work the next day he is able to pick right back up and finish the beat. After he is done the website automatically will save it for him and archive it with a name of his choosing, which satisfies him as he can track his progress over time.
